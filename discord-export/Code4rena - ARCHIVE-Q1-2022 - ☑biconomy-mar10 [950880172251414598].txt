What's the advantage for the end user using cross-chain liquidity pools vs a bridge that just locks tokens ?


[03/10/2022 12:42 AM] hickuphh3
Get rewarded from dynamic transfer fees I suppose


[03/10/2022 12:52 AM] pedroais
Yes when the pool is in deficit state


[03/10/2022 12:52 AM] pedroais
But what about equilibrium state?


[03/10/2022 12:54 AM] pedroais
If everything works properly the pool should be in equilibrium most of the time right ?


[03/10/2022 12:54 AM] pedroais
Then why would I use it vs a regular bridge ?


[03/10/2022 6:50 AM] sachintomar
Pool won't be in equilibrium state most of the time but will try to be in equilibrium state... So will oscillate between deficit and excess state.. 
And also hyphen doesn't mint new wrapped asset and just transfer the existing assets to user from the pool... another advantage of using Hyphen is speed of transfers.. it's quite fast compared to other bridges... And fee is here is dynamic unlike other bridges..

Mainly regular bridge will be slower than cross chain liquidity pools


[03/10/2022 12:16 PM] pedroais
Thank you

I will assume executors are trusted as they have full control over the funds with the `sendFundsToUser` function


[03/12/2022 3:52 PM] thro77le
What is the advantage of using NFT as a liquidity asset?


[03/14/2022 9:30 AM] __acidichydrogen__
Yup, in this current mode lwe haven't decentralised executors, you'll also notice that there are no incentives for the executors either


[03/14/2022 9:32 AM] __acidichydrogen__
For one it makes accounting a lot easier and cam store a lot more information. Instead of just giving ERC20 tokens we give users an NFT which could contain arbitrary metadata, while still allowing holders to transfer it.
In our case, we use it to track pending and unclaimed rewards since the user first claimed their NFT, and also to store how much the user originally provided as Liquidity

how do i burn nft?


[03/14/2022 12:00 PM] windowhan001
When I analyzed the code, I guess nft could not be burned.


[03/14/2022 12:01 PM] windowhan001
Is there no need for nft  burn function?


[03/14/2022 3:17 PM] thro77le
How are the executors notified to take action? Based on event emissions ?


[03/14/2022 3:29 PM] __acidichydrogen__
to claim your liquidity back you just call the removeLiquidityFunction, otherwise there is no function to burn a particular NFT


[03/14/2022 3:29 PM] __acidichydrogen__
Yup, we have watch towers (event listeners) that listen for events emitted on each chain


[03/15/2022 7:01 AM] dravee
See comments below 😂 . I love "the Unburnt" one
```jsx
File: LiquidityFarming.sol
177:     /// @param _to Receiver of the tokens, first of his name, rightful heir to the lost tokens,
178:     /// reightful owner of the extra tokens, and ether, protector of mistaken transfers, mother of token reclaimers,
179:     /// the Khaleesi of the Great Token Sea, the Unburnt, the Breaker of blockchains.
180:     function reclaimTokens(
```

🙂 nice one guys


[03/15/2022 4:21 PM] pedroais
What's the purpose of having total and per wallet limits to liquidity ?


[03/15/2022 5:13 PM] __acidichydrogen__
we forked the Sushiswap Masterchef V2 contract here, props to the original creator!


[03/15/2022 5:14 PM] __acidichydrogen__
Initially we'll have a community liquidity funding period, the caps just ensure that more people get the opportunity to add liquidity.


[03/15/2022 5:15 PM] pedroais
But why limit the total ? Why just not let everyone add all the liquidity they want ?


[03/15/2022 5:15 PM] pedroais
And can't people just add liquidity from different wallets ?


[03/15/2022 5:17 PM] __acidichydrogen__
It's to maintain a decent apy for LPs. If the added liquidity is too high, it dilutes the apy for everyone


[03/15/2022 5:18 PM] __acidichydrogen__
yup, they can. as you mentioned if people really want to add more liquidity we can't really do much about it, it's more of a soft deterrent


[03/15/2022 5:19 PM] pedroais
Ok


[03/15/2022 5:19 PM] pedroais
Thank you


[03/16/2022 12:06 AM] acegawd
Which one of the devs can I DM?


[03/16/2022 1:22 PM] __acidichydrogen__
feel free to dm me


[03/16/2022 5:30 PM] pedroais
I've sent you a friend request

If we have low-impact/QA bugs, would biconomy like for the low-impact/QA bugs to be placed into one single report?


[03/16/2022 6:46 PM] thank_you_
Nvm, the answer is yes 🙂


[03/16/2022 8:55 PM] Ahmed Al-Balaghi#8248
Thanks guys. Loving the questions and comments


[03/16/2022 8:56 PM] Ahmed Al-Balaghi#8248
Our design is about having a healthy cap to tvl. No point having hundreds of millions of dollars in tvl if it’s not being used.


[03/16/2022 8:56 PM] Ahmed Al-Balaghi#8248
And allows those LPs to get healthy APYs without being diluted as Ankur mentioned

Hi there! The sponsor is reviewing the judge's decisions this week. If no further discussion is needed between the judge and sponsor after that, then hopefully this one will be finishing up soon. 🤞
